        "description": "<div class='pj-description'> <h2>peLaFottaEUCF2024 — Player Evaluation of BFD La Fotta at EUCF 2024</h2> <p> In Ultimate Frisbee, performance isn’t only about goals and assists. A large part of a player’s impact comes from decision-making, defensive pressure, and reliability under stress. Those aspects are usually present in the data, but rarely structured in a way that supports clear evaluation. </p> <p> <b>peLaFottaEUCF2024</b> is a player evaluation system built to turn raw match events into a structured, repeatable workflow for measuring individual impact. The project combines custom KPIs with clutch-time analysis to answer a practical question: <b>who is driving outcomes, and under which conditions?</b> </p> <h3>What problem this project solves</h3> <p> Traditional statistics compress too much information into a small number of counters. This project focuses on <b>extracting signal from noisy event data</b>, separating workload from effectiveness, and making performance comparable across players and game contexts. </p> <h3>Workload and involvement</h3> <p> The first step is understanding <b>who is actually involved in play</b>. Possessions played act as a proxy for workload and tactical trust. </p> <div class='pj-image'> <img src='assets/img/1-5_pss_played.png' alt='Top 5 players by possessions played' class='responsive project-photo'> <p class='img-caption'> Top players by possessions played. This highlights which players consistently handle high volumes of play, independent of scoring output. </p> </div> <p> Raw workload alone is not enough. The same measure becomes more meaningful when isolated to <b>high-pressure situations</b>. </p> <div class='pj-image'> <img src='assets/img/1-5_clutch_pss_played.png' alt='Top 5 players by clutch possessions played' class='responsive project-photo'> <p class='img-caption'> Top players by possessions played in clutch moments. This shows who is trusted when the margin for error is minimal. </p> </div> <h3>Custom KPIs: measuring impact, not just outcomes</h3> <p> To move beyond surface-level stats, I designed two custom Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that operate on cleaned and aggregated event data. </p> <ul> <li> <b>Scoring Impact</b> — captures contribution to offensive success beyond just goals and assists. </li> <li> <b>Block Creation</b> — highlights defensive impact by accounting for disruption and forced errors, not only recorded blocks. </li> </ul> <p> Together, these metrics allow players to be compared across offensive and defensive dimensions, instead of treating them as separate roles. </p> <div class='pj-image'> <img src='assets/img/scoring_vs_block.png' alt='Scoring Impact vs Block Creation' class='responsive project-photo'> <p class='img-caption'> Scoring Impact vs Block Creation. This view separates specialists from true two-way contributors. </p> </div> <h3>Clutch-time analysis</h3> <p> Performance stability under pressure is often the difference between winning and losing. The clutch-time analysis isolates possessions played in high-stakes situations to compare how player impact changes when the context becomes unstable. </p> <div class='pj-image'> <img src='assets/img/clutch_scoring_vs_block.png' alt='Clutch Scoring Impact vs Block Creation' class='responsive project-photo'> <p class='img-caption'> Clutch-time Scoring Impact vs Block Creation. This highlights players who maintain or improve their effectiveness when pressure increases. </p> </div> <h3>Engineering notes</h3> <ul> <li> <b>Repeatable pipeline</b>: raw events → cleaning → aggregation → KPI computation → ranking → visualization </li> <li> <b>Metric design</b>: KPIs are designed to be interpretable and decision-oriented, not purely mathematical </li> <li> <b>Separation of concerns</b>: workload, effectiveness, and clutch behavior are treated as distinct dimensions </li> </ul> <h3>Making results usable</h3> <p> Outputs are designed to answer concrete questions quickly: who carries workload, who converts it into impact, and who remains reliable when conditions deteriorate. </p> <div class='pj-image'> <img src='assets/img/scoring_impact.png' alt='Scoring Impact ranking' class='responsive project-photo'> <p class='img-caption'> Scoring Impact ranking (normal vs clutch).

Defensive contribution stability under pressure. </p> </div> <h3>Final thoughts</h3> <p> peLaFottaEUCF2024 is not just a sports analytics project. It’s an example of building a <b>structured evaluation system</b>: defining metrics, handling noisy inputs, and producing outputs that can be trusted in real decision-making contexts. </p> <p> The same approach applies to software systems more broadly: take imperfect inputs, design clear processing steps, and deliver results that people can actually use. </p> </div>",
